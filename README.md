# AwkwardScilence

This is an app for android that helps you if you can't find a subject to converse about.
So basically what you do is tap "FIND", and the app will randomly choose a topic from a set of preset topics.
Alternatively you can tap "ADD" and add a topic for later.

To Do:

Add a way to carry out the functions as a widget, or on the home screen.

Add a way to put categories of things you can choose from like I might not want to talk sports with a scientist so I should be able to choose from sub categories.
